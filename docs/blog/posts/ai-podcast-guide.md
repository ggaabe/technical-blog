## Step 2: Create a New Notebook

1. Click on the "New Notebook" button to initiate a new project.

## Step 3: Add Source Materials

1. In your new notebook, add the documents that really sell your company's value proposition. I recommend uploading case studies, testimonials, and anything describing your unique selling points or products.
2. You can upload various formats, including Google Docs, Google Slides, PDFs, and URLs.
3. Ensure the content is comprehensive and accurately represents your company's profile.

## Step 4: Generate an Audio Overview

1. Once your sources are uploaded, locate the "Studio" to the right of the screen.
2. Under the "Audio Overview" section, click on the "Customize" button.
3. Enter instructions to guide the AI podcast hosts to specifically focus on how your company's products or services benefit clients.
4. Click on the "Generate" button under the "Audio Overview" section.
5. Wait for the AI to process your documents and create an audio summary.

## Step 5: Review and Download

1. After generation, review the audio to ensure it aligns with your expectations.
2. Download the audio file for distribution or further editing.

## Considerations

- **Content Quality**: The effectiveness of the podcast heavily depends on the quality and clarity of the source materials provided.
- **AI Limitations**: While NotebookLM offers a robust starting point, the AI-generated content may require additional editing to meet specific standards or preferences.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create a podcast that highlights your company's strengths and offerings.
